                <p>
                    I am currently graduating in IT data analytics at NSCC. With a background in Mathematics, I started my career as a project engineer at a hard disk drive manufacturing company where I used JMP to build regression models that predicted hard disk yield. <br><br>
                    My ability to consolidate different sources of data and manipulate them provided valuable insights to the management, ultimately saving the cost of production.<br><br>
                    I then worked in an international bank where I supported bankers with creating charts and presentations using Microsoft Office. In 2011, I earned a master's degree in data science and business statistics and moved on to work as a business analyst at a construction equipment company.
                    There, I prepared management statistics reports from historical sales data, customer trends, calculated the product price, and worked on yearly budget. I also worked on user acceptance tests with the IT department, showcasing my analytical and technical skills.
